## Introduction to React Hooks

React Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle.

### Why Hooks?

Before Hooks, stateful logic in React components was primarily managed through class components. This often led to:
-   **Large components:** Components that are hard to break down and test.
-   **Wrapper hell:** A proliferation of higher-order components and render props.
-   **Confusing classes:** `this` keyword, binding methods, and understanding lifecycle methods could be challenging.

Hooks aim to solve these problems by allowing you to:
-   Reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.
-   Split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods.

### Basic Hooks

1.  **`useState`**:
    Allows you to add React state to function components.
    ```javascript
    import { useState } from 'react';

    function Counter() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      return (
        <div>
          <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
            Click me
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

2.  **`useEffect`**:
    Lets you perform side effects in function components. It's a close replacement for `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components.
    ```javascript
    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

    function Example() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
      useEffect(() => {
        // Update the document title using the browser API
        document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
      });

      return (
        <div>
          {/* ... */}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

### Rules of Hooks
- Only call Hooks at the **top level**. Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- Only call Hooks from **React function components** or **custom Hooks**.

## Conclusion
React Hooks offer a powerful and expressive way to write components. They make code more readable, reusable, and easier to test.
